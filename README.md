Public version of the ARA tool code

This tool was developed as part of the European Hackathon of SAIs in Prague, 3-5 March 2020. See https://hackathon.eurosai2020.cz

Our tool translates ever-increasing amount of data into actionable audit intelligence to maximize insight and gain audit quality.

As data evolves it requires open, flexible, and customized visual intelligence to assess risk. With our flexible dashboard ARA: the Advanced Risk Assessment tool you spend less time waiting and utilize more time to analyze risk.

With ARA we quantify the risk of material misstatements. We provide intelligent analytics by using multiple financial and non-financial datasources, statistical modelling and many advanced techniques.
